# :rocket: REAL TIME CHAT WITH SOCKET IO
***
### This project allows me to understand how to communicate between two users along side with socket io
***
###### I used Node.js, React, MongoDB, Socket io. In terms of UI design, I imported Daisy UI public libary which is for tailwind CSS.

###### In terms of reference, I refered to <https://github.com/burakorkmez/fullstack-chat-app> this project which allows me to better understand Socket.io **Many thanks to him :pray:**
###### :v:Bascically, I added an further function which is a message status based on cloning this project. Therefore, I have been used to using socket io.

###### :exclamation: However, as of yet I am still working on Sidebar part with read/unread status (11.01.25) + I need to consider UI/UX allgin for Sidebar
